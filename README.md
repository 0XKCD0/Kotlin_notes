Notes for Kotlin 

### What is Kotlin?
__________________________

* New programming language by JetBrains.
* JetBrains developed software like Android Studio, IntelliJ, Idea, pyCharm, etc.
* It Targets JVM, Android, Native and Js.


### Features of Kotlin
_____________________________

1. Statically typed language - It means before source code is compiled, the type associated with each and every single variable must be known. or Kotlin is a statically typed language which means that it does most the check at compile time rather being dependent on runtime.
2. Object Oriented - Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism.
3. Functional Lnguage (Higher Order Function) - If your function accepts function as a parameter or returns function as a result than itâ€™s called high order function.
```
fun addValue(operation:(Int,Int) -> Int):Int {
  return operation(10,20)
}
addValue{num1,num2 -> num1 * num2} //This will print 200
addValue{num1,num2 -> num1 - num2} //This will print -10
```
4. Interoperable - It is 100% interoperable with Java.
5. Concise - Less lines of code.
6. Safe - Kotlin's type system is aimed at eliminating the danger of null references, also known as The Billion Dollar Mistake.

<mark>Null Pointer exception - It is a runtime exception in Java that occurs when a variable is accessed which is not pointing to any object and refers to nothing or null.</mark>

7. Open Source - Anyone can use it.


### Why JAVA (JDK) ?
________________________________________

KOTLIN FILES(.kt) -----(compile)------->  Byte Code -----(run)---->     JVM

### Hello Program
____________________________________________

```
fun firstProgram(){
  println("Hello")
}
```

### Function
____________________________________________

Functions are a set of instructions to perform some task.

Syntax:
```
fun fun_name(input arguements)
{
  some task
  //....
  //...
}
```
### Compilation
____________________________

Kotlin ----(KotlinC-JVM)---> Byte code(.class files) ---------> JVM --------> OUTPUT

### Variables
___________________________

* Simple box to store and hold data.
* Each variable has a name to access its data.
* var and val
    + var can be reassigned.
    + val cannot be reassigned.


 ### Operators
 ________________________________________

 1. Arithematic Operators:
     + Addition(+)
     + Subtraction(-)
     + Multiplication(*)
     + Division(/)
     + Modulous(%)

2. Relational Operators:
      + Less than (<)
      + Greather than (>)
      + Less than equal to (<=)
      + Greather than equal to (>=)
      + Structural Equality (==)
      + Not equals (!=)

  3. Logical Operators:
     + AND (&&)
     + OR (||)
     + NOT (!)

  4. Short Circuiting: It refers to the behavior of logical operators (e.g., && for AND and || for OR) where the second operand is only         evaluated if the result can be determined from the first operand. This means that in certain situations, the second operand is not         evaluated at all, which can improve performance and prevent potential errors.
```
Short Circuiting (AND)
val x = false
val y = true
val result = x && y  // 'y' is not evaluated because 'x' is false

```
```
Short Circuiting (OR)
val x = true
val y = false
val result = x || y  // 'y' is not evaluated because 'x' is true

```
